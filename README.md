# 50-W-12V-220V-inverter-design

12V DC to 220 V ac for the wattage range of 50 W utility
according to the transformer it can be also used for
12V DC to the 110V ac applications.
it i s designed with the help of 555 timer with the combination of passive elements from 12 volt dc to pulsating
5V AC output then it is feed to the switching circuit containing high current rating then step up 
with the help of center tapped transformer and fed to alternator obtainning 110/ 220 V as per utility.
