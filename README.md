# 50-W-12V-220V-inverter-design using 555 timer

12V DC to 220 V ac for the wattage range of 50 W utility
according to the transformer it can be also used for
12V DC to the 110V ac applications.
it i s designed with the help of 555 timers with the combination of passive elements from 12-volt dc to pulsating
5V AC output then it is feed to the switching circuit containing a high current rating then step up 
with the help of center tapped transformer and fed to the alternator obtaining 110/ 220 V as per utility.
